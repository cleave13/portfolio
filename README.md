# Portfolio

## Description
This project provided an opportunity to apply a wide range of HTML and CSS skills that we've been learning in the DU Bootcamp. It also gave me a chance to apply many of the UX skills that I picked up during my recent Udemy course that I completed over our Christmas break.

I approached this project from a slightly different lens than the prompt. Since I'm not seeking a career change after this bootcamp, I didn't present the information as though I was looking for a junior developer job. I approached it instead from the perspective of an independent consultant who was targeting a new client as their potential "employer".

The projects highlighted in this portfolio page all represent a fledgling business ideas or passion projects for me. My hope is that the skills gained in this bootcamp can bring elements of each idea to life.

This exercise taught me a ton about HTML and CSS, and even presented a chance to dabble in some JavaScript for the mobile hamburger menu. I feel much more comfortable with identifying the HTML containers required to style a page, and how to target specific elements using more complex CSS selectors. This was also my first "from scratch" application for using media queries and CSS variables and I found it to be a very fun challenge to take a mobile-first approach to developing a webpage.

## Installation
There is no installation required for this project. To see the live final product, you can navigate to the following [Github portfolio link](https://cleave13.github.io/portfolio/ "portfolio link").

## Usage
This simple page has three primary features:
1. Mobile Hamburger menu - This feature becomes available at the top-right portion of the page for screens 480px or smaller.
2. Internal Links - When you click on the "portfolio", "about", or "contact" links, the browser will automatically navigate to that page.
3. External links - The Github link is the only external link in this project. When clicked, it opens my generic Github profile page in the user's browser.

## Credits

There were no collaborators on this project, but there are several tutorials and resources that helped me develop this page:

### YouTube Responsive Menu Tutorial
The [codefoxx YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvi0rWTSkJkrunfhXH0tYuA "codefoxx YouTube Channel") channel has some great reasources to help developers. I used the following tutorial to build the mobile responsive hamburger menu.

### Joe Natoli's User Experience Design Resources
Joe Natoli is a consultant with 20+ years experience doing UI and UX design. His website is [givegoodux.com](https://givegoodux.com/user-experience-design-fundamentals/ "givegoodux.com"). I found the following two courses to be excellent primers to UX design as I had no previous experience in this realm.

- [User Experience Design Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/user-experience-design-fundamentals/ "User Experience Design Fundamentals")
- [UX & Web Design Master Course: Strategy, Design, Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/ux-web-design-master-course-strategy-design-development/ "UX & Web Design Master Course: Strategy, Design, Development")
